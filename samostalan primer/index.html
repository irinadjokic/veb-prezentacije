    <p> Oliver Dragojević (pronounced [ǒliʋer drâɡojeʋitɕ]; 7 December 1947 – 29 July 2018) was a Croatian singer and composer, who was considered one of the most enduring musical stars  and cultural icons in Croatia with a discography that spanned nearly five decades.[2] His style blended traditional klapa melodies of Dalmatia, a coastal region in his native Croatia, with jazz motifs wrapped up in a modern production.

    For his influential musical career, he reached critical and commercial acclaim in Croatia and neighbouring countries, and numerous accolades, including numerous Porin and Indexi awards. He is one of the few Croatian musicians who performed at major international venues such as Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall, L'Olympia, and Sydney Opera House.[3] In 1995, he was awarded the Order of Danica Hrvatska for his services to culture.[4]</p>

        <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p style="color:rgb(199, 155, 33)" >
                Oliver's mother Kata (1907–1994) and father Marko Dragojević (1908–1991) had three daughters, all of whom died young during World War II. His family escaped to a refugee camp in El Shatt, Egypt, together with many other women and children from Dalmatia.[3]

                 Dragojević was born on 7 December 1947 in Split, not long after his family returned to their ancestral town of Vela Luka, on the Dalmatian island of Korčula. He had an older brother Aljoša (1946–2011). When Oliver was five, his father bought each of his sons a harmonica. Oliver mastered the instrument quickly, and entertained other kids on his street, as well as passengers on board of ships on the busy route of Vela Luka – Split. As Dragojević showed a strong passion for music, his parents decided to enroll him in a music school in his hometown. There he learned to play the piano, clarinet and bass guitar.[3]

            <p class='suffux'>
                 Dragojević's first performance was at the Split Children's Festival in 1961 with the song "Baloni" (Baloons). In a competition of amateur singers, his cult band from Split, Batali, won the first place for their rendition of "Yesterday", a Beatles classic. In 1972 Dragojević went abroad to further develop his craft. He played in clubs across Germany, Sweden and Mexico. His solo singing career began in 1974 at the Split Festival, where he won with the song "Ča će mi Copacabana" (What Do I Need Copacabana For).[5]

                A year later, composer Zdenko Runjić and Dragojević, released the song "Galeb i ja" (Seagull and I); it proved to be a big hit across the former Yugoslavia and made Dragojević a household name. That was followed by hits "Romanca" (Romance), "Oprosti mi, pape" (Forgive Me, Father), "Stari morski vuk" (An Old Sea Wolf). Runjić would further collaborate with Dragojević on further 200 songs, until Runjić's death. Between 1975 and 1980, the Dragojević/Runjić duo dominated the music scene of the former Yugoslavia. Part of the secret of their success was a third contributor, Jakša Fiamengo, who wrote the lyrics to some of Dragojević's most iconic songs, namely: "Nadalina", "Piva klapa ispo' volta" (The Klapa Sings Under the Vault), "Karoca" (Carriage), "Ništa nova" (Nothing New), "Infiša san u te" (I Am Crazy About You), and "Ostavljam te samu" (I Leave You Alone).[3] In 1990 Dragojević won the Split Festival with "Ti si moj san" (You Are My Dream), and the Jugovizija Jamboree with the song "Sreća je tamo gdje si ti" (Happiness is Where You Are), both collaboration with Zorica Kondža.[6][7]
